My dissertation research focused on phytoplankton phenology based on satellite remote sensing and water samples. Phytoplankton pigments chlorophyll-*a* and pheophytin were used to observe shifts in bloom cycles in the summer and fall months in the Bering and Chukchi Seas. This work was funded by the National Science Foundation. 
<br><br>

Additional aspects of this research including identifying fall blooms and upscaling water-column chlorophyll-*a* using nadir-viewing technologies were supported by the Edna Bailey Sussman Fund, Association of Polar Early Career Scientists, and the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Foundation.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```
-->
{% endraw %}
